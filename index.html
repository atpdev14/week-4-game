<!-- 
-generate a random number that has a higher range, this will serve as the goal the user must reach
-generate random numbers with a smaller range
-Create a loop that will propagate four images of crystals that hold a smaller random number
-use an on-click event to add the associated value to the user's running total
-use conditional statements to determine when the user's runnnig total is equal to the goal or if it exceeds the goal
